# Tip Calculator

## Overview

The Tip Calculator is a simple and user-friendly Python program that allows you to quickly calculate tips and sales tax on restaurant bills or other expenses. It takes the charge for the food as input and then calculates both an 18% tip and a 7% sales tax on the provided charge. Finally, it displays each of these amounts separately and calculates the total amount to be paid, including the charge, tip, and tax.
